# USCovidStatistics

US Covid Statistics is more of a Global Covid Statistics app at this point by accessing repputable data from places such as John Hopkins University to gather and display daily information about Covid-19. Data is fetched using OkHttp and RxJava, ViewBinding for easier user interface changes, and is using Model-View-Presenter/MVP architecture.
