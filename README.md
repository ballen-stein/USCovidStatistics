# USCovidStatistics

US Covid Statistics is more of a Global Covid Statistics app at this point by accessing repputable data from places such as John Hopkins University to gather and display daily information about Covid-19. Data is fetched using OkHttp and RxJava, ViewBinding for easier user interface changes, and is using Model-View-Presenter/MVP architecture.

## Base Use example
Below is a quick view of the app's functionality, before any additional fine-tuning and features are added.
